# Codename: The Collector

A series of backends serving GraphQL APIs focusing on specific categories of collection types (Comics, Books, Video Games, Cards Games, etc).

Each category of a collection can be thought of as a domain with its own data models and entities.

The goal is to explore diffeferent approaches to building seperate GraphQL schemas for each category type, each with a new language or new framework/toolset.

Through this repition I should start to understand the high level GraphQL space and its common patterns and abstractions.

At some point, I should have enough schemas to look at schema composition and conslidating the experience through a single client. I could compare "GraphQL as a Service" options versus rolling my own.

Hosted on AWS? (Front-end possibly on Netlify/Vercel?)
